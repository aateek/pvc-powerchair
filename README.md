## Getting Involved

We welcome new contributors!

First, there is a Google Group mailing list for development discussion:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/robomakery-pvc-chair

Please join that group and introduce yourself.  We also have bi-weekly online planning meetings via Zoom.

If you are in the San Diego area, we also meet to discuss this project on the first Tuesday of every month as part of the [San Diego Robotics Club](https://www.meetup.com/roboticsclub/).
