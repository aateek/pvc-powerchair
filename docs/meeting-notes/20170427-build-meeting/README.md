PVC Chair Build Meeting
=======================

Attendees:

* Aki Saitoh
* Dylan Vaughn
* Steven Berneberg

Notes:

We had to cut 1/2 inch off of both PIPE6 segments, from 9" to 8.5" to get it to fit.

TODO: Look into calculations more to see if it was our mistake or something with calculations in general.
